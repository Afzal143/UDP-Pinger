UDP-Pinger
Send and receive Datagram packets using UDP sockets and also, how to set a proper socket timeout.
programs use a simpler protocol, UDP, rather than the standard Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to communicate with each other. The ping protocol allows a client machine to send a packet of data to a remote machine, and have the remote machine return the data back to the client unchanged (an action referred to as echoing). Among other uses, the ping protocol allows hosts to determine round-trip times to other machines.
